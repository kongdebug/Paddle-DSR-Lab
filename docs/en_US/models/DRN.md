A paddle implementation of the paper DRN: Closed-loop Matters: Dual Regression Networks for
Single Image Super-Resolution, 
[\[CVPR 2020\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018.pdf)


## Abstract
Deep neural networks have exhibited promising performance in image super-resolution (SR) by learning a non-linear mapping function from low-resolution (LR) images to high-resolution (HR) images. However, there are two underlying limitations to existing SR methods. First, learning the mapping function from LR to HR images is typically an ill-posed problem, because there exist infinite HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a result, the space of the possible functions can be extremely large, which makes it hard to find a good solution. Second, the paired LR-HR data may be unavailable in real-world applications and the underlying degradation method is often unknown. For such a more general case, existing SR models often incur the adaptation problem and yield poor per-formance. To address the above issues, we propose a dual regression scheme by introducing an additional constraint on LR data to reduce the space of the possible functions. Specifically, besides the mapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping estimates the down-sampling kernel and reconstruct LR images, which forms a closed-loop to provide additional supervision. More critically, since the dual regression process does not depend on HR images, we can directly learn from LR images. In
this sense, we can easily adapt SR models to real-world data, e.g., raw video frames from YouTube. Extensive experiments with paired training data and unpaired real-world data demonstrate our superiority over existing methods.


## Data prepare

Download the 2 dataset: [data_all](docs/en_US/datasets/data_all.md), [DSR-TestData](docs/en_US/datasets/DSR-TestData.md) . Unzip and place the `data_all` folder (containing 133 depth maps) and the `test_data` folder (containing 4 test data) into the following locations.

```shell
data/
  ├── data_all/
  │   ├── alley_1_1.png
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── ...
  ├── test_data/
  │   ├── cones_x4.mat
  │   ├── teddy_x4.mat
  │   ├── tskuba_x4.mat
  │   └── venus_x4.mat
```

Using the `matlab` software, execute the `data/process_pmba/generate_train_LR.m` script to generate the high-resolution and low-resolution depth map pairs of the training data, note that when using it, modify the path of the `data_all` folder in the script, and after running, name the high-resolution depth map folder as `data_ all_HR_x4` and the low-resolution depth map folder as `data_all_LR_x4`, and create a new `PMBA` folder under the `data` folder, and put the above folders into this folder.

In the test data set, the image files are stored in mat file format, execute the `data/process_pmba/generate_test_data.py` script to generate the test set in `.png` format.

**Note**: The processed dataset has been uploaded to the AI Studio platform at the following link: https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetdetail/173618


## Training

As the DRN network is designed for the image super-segmentation task, the input channels to the network are reserved for 3. The following command is executed to train the DRN using the `PMBA` dataset

```shell
python -u tools/main.py --config-file configs/drn_dsr_x4.yaml
```

## Evaluation
**DSR-TestData**

Execute the following command to test the `DSR-TestData` dataset
```shell
python -u tools/main.py --config-file configs/drn_dsr_x4.yaml --evaluate-only --load drn_x4_best.pdparams
```
