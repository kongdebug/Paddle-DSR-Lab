## Abstract
Despite the remarkable progresses achieved in depth map super-resolution (DSR), it remains a major challenge to tackle with real-world degradation of low-resolution (LR) depth maps. Synthetic datasets are mainly used in existing DSR approaches, which is quite different from what would get from a real depth sensor. Besides, the enhancements of features in existing DSR approaches are not sufficiently enough, which also limit the performance. To alleviate these problems, we first propose two types of degradation models to describe the generation of LR depth maps, including bi-cubic down-sampling with noise and interval down-sampling, and different DSR models are learned correspondingly. Then, we propose a weighted attention fusion strategy that is embedded into a progressive residual learning framework, which guarantees that the high-resolution (HR) depth maps can be well recovered in a coarse-to-fine manner. The weighted attention fusion strategy can enhance the features with abundant high-frequency components in both global and local manners, thus better HR depth maps can be expected. Besides, to re-use the effective information in the progressive process sufficiently, a multi-stage fusion module is combined into the proposed framework, and the Total Generalized Variation (TGV) regularization and input loss are exploited to further improve the performance of our method. Extensive experiments of different benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.


## Data prepare

Download the 2 dataset: [data_all](docs/en_US/datasets/data_all.md), [DSR-TestData](docs/en_US/datasets/DSR-TestData.md) . Unzip and place the `data_all` folder (containing 133 depth maps) and the `test_data` folder (containing 4 test data) into the following locations.

```shell
data/
  ├── data_all/
  │   ├── alley_1_1.png
  │   ├── ...
  │   └── ...
  ├── test_data/
  │   ├── cones_x4.mat
  │   ├── teddy_x4.mat
  │   ├── tskuba_x4.mat
  │   └── venus_x4.mat
```

The depth map in `data_all` needs to be downsampled and then the depth-dependent Gaussian noise is added to the low-resolution training data as θ(d) = N(0, δ/d), where δ = 651 and d denotes the depth value of each pixel in the DL. Using the `matlab` software, execute the `data/process_wafp/generate_train_noise.m` script to generate the training data `train_depth_x4_noise.h5`, taking care to modify the `data_all` folder path in the script when using.

**Note**: The processed training set `train_depth_x4_noise.h5` has been uploaded to the AI Studio platform at the following link: https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetdetail/154330
